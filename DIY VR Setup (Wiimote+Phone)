Setup:

Part #1

-- Download the iVRy free software on computer and launch it
-- it should try to connect to the device via WiFi or USB, ignore it and close everything (best to restart)
-- Launch Creaminstaller and make it check for iVRy DLCs and enable the paid Cardboard or phone VR one (changes thru version to version)
-- Computer restart is nessecary, best to restart phone too
-- After restart, Launch the iVRy app on phone and connect the USB cable, also plug it into the computer

-- Launch iVRy client on PC
-- Successfully set up the headset!

Part #2
-- Close every app, after that launch the Driver4VR thru the emulator (Nemirtingas)
-- It should automatically set itself up
-- Close Driver4VR and SteamVR
-- Start SteamVR and check if the iVRy adn Driver4VR opens, if not, try checking if it's enabled in SteamVR
-- On Driver4VR click Start
-- Go to Hand tracking and select Virtual Trackers
-- Click Tracker manager and Turn on the Wiimote(s) you have and connect it to your computer via bluetooth, after that assign em to each hand in Driver4VR
-- Click Stop and then Start again

One big Restart to make sure and then you should be ready to go!
Have fun mate!
